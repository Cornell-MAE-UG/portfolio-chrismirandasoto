    My name is Christopher Miranda Soto, and I am a Cornell Mechanical Engineering Student, passionate about fields like robotics, data analytics, and  environmental sustainability. I enjoy spending time working on developing sustainable technology to help provide safe and clean water to those in need with my project team, AguaClara, engaging in my Mexican heritage through my involvement in Salsa Pa'lante and Cornell's Mariachi, and expressing my faith through leadership roles in CRU.
