For my MAE3230 Fluid Mechanics class, we were tasked with creating a video dissection of an assigned engineering device that utilizes fluids. 
My team was given a pneumatic grinder, which we were able to break down into several small components and analyze thoroughly. Our video includes explanations 
of the overall functionality of the device, the individual roles of certain components, a fluid streamline diagram of the device, and the fluids 
equations and assumptions behind the behavior of the device. The video can be found in the Youtube link below:
